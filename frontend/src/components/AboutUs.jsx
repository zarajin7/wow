            World of Work (WOW) Programme – Kitale Kenya
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            World of Work is a project of VMM Africa trading as Association of
            Mission Volunteers (AMV). It is a project which piloted in Kitale
            commencing January 2021. It results from work carried out by VMM
            during 2019 and 2020 when there was various engagement with street
            connected youth and various stakeholders. The programme focuses
            primarily on participants (aged 17 -24 years old) who are homeless
            and living on the streets of Kitale. The initial pilot WOW 1 and the
            subsequent WOW 2 group just involved males. During WOW 3 girls have
            come to the programme and will continue to be a focus for the
            programme going forward.

            settled into a house and be in a position to begin to build on
            skills learned by way of apprenticeship, supported employment, or be
            assisted to run a small business.
